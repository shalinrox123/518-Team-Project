# 518-Team-Project

* For the drop down, the api used for getting the list of states and coressponding cities don't line up with the list of cities in another api, so some cities will lead to an error
  * If it does lead to an error, go to the previous page and pick another city 
* The sources that we used for our modules are in our indivual folders.
  * Some of us have them as sources.txt and some of us cited the API's in the code
