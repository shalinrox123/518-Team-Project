## Main Intructions

1. Download Chrome
1. Go to chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure

1. In the input box, enter http://ec2-3-91-233-85.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/
1. Then click on the drop down menu and change it to Enable
1. Click on "relaunch" 
1. Go to the URL (http://ec2-3-91-233-85.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080) 
1. Allow User location
1. Refresh the page

## Important information
* The location program only works with Chrome
* For the drop down, the api used for getting the list of states and coressponding cities don't line up with the list of cities in another api, so some cities will lead to an error
  * If it does lead to an error, go to the previous page and pick another city 
* The sources that we used for our modules are in our indivual folders.
  * Some of us have them as sources.txt and some of us cited the API's in the code
* There is a file called .DS_Store that is in the repository a few times. Thats because some of us are mac users and thats a hidden file. Just watch out for that, it might not allow the file ti run. Delete it if it causes any issues
